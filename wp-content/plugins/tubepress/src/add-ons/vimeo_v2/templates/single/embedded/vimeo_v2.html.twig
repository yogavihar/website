{#
 # If you decided to edit this template (and we do not recommend that you do so), keep in mind
 # the following:
 #
 # 1. If you do not set the "id" and "name" attribute on the <iframe>, TubePress Pro will do so on your behalf.
 #
 # 2. If you *do* set the "id" attribute, you must set the "name" attribute and its value must be identical
 #    to the "id" attribute. This value must be "globally" unique - do not set it to the video ID or anything
 #    that might be repeated elsewhere on the page. Failure to do so will break user functionality.
 #
 # 3. Do not remove the "js-tubepress-embed" class or you will break user functionality. You may add additional classes.
